# github-final-project

## Scenario

You recently got hired as a developer in a micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide opportunities to low income individuals. The core team currently uses Subversion (SVN) for managing code. They want to slowly move their code to Git. You are asked to host their sample code to calculate simple interest on GitHub in a new repository as the first step in this journey. You will not only host the script, but also follow best practices introduced in this course and create supporting documents for the open source project including code of conduct, and contributing guidelines. Additionally, the repository should be available to the community under the Apache License 2.0.

## Objectives

After completing this lab you will have demonstrated that you can:

1. Create a new repository in your GitHub account.
2. Select an appropriate license for your project.
3. Create main README.md markdown file that explains the purpose of the project.
4. Create Code of Conduct markdown that explains how you want the community to behave and interact with each other.
5. Create Contribution Guidelines markdown that tells the community how to contribute.
6. Commit new file to the repository.

Note: Throughout this lab you will be prompted copy and paste URLs into a notepad and save the notepad on your own device. These URLs will be uploaded for peer review in the Final Submission section of the course. You can use any notepad app to keep note of your URLs.
